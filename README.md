## Domain Modeling

when the user enters the web page, he starts by logging into our website with the username and password. this will generate an access token for the user, this will git the user's data from the first table (Users table), and will grant him the ability to add his own farms in the (My Farms table), and at last, it will give him the ability to check the available farms inside the (All Farms) table.

the image above shows the flow of the backend side

for the front end, if the user is not signed in, he will have access to the home page, and the search page, to search for farms, but the non-registered user can't add his own farm, if the user is signed in, he will be able to access the form to add his own farm.
